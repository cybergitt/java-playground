## Encapsulation

Encapsulation refers to wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds code and the data it manipulates. Another way to think about encapsulation is, it is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield. In this, the variables or data of a class is hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of own class in which they are declared.

Encapsulation in Java can be achieved by:
- Declaring the variables of a class as private.
- Providing public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.
