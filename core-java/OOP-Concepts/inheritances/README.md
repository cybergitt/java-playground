## Inheritance

Inheritance is an integral part of Java OOPs which lets the properties of one class to be inherited by the other. It basically, helps in reusing the code and establish a relationship between different classes. 

As we know, a child inherits the properties from his parents. A similar concept is followed in Java, where we have two classes:
1. Parent class ( Super or Base class )
2. Child class ( Subclass or Derived class )
A class which inherits the properties is known as Child Class whereas a class whose properties are inherited is known as Parent class.
